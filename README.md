Just some daily exercises, code snippets. Probably rewrites of old code. I can't remember everything so also storing some commonly used things here. Initially started this repo for my reference only, and with good intentions to share - however, depending on what is going on it's been challenging to keep up to date.  I will try.

## Folders
* templates - template code
* leet - exercises from leetcode
* projects - anything i'm currently working on but don't want to start a new repo for
* ref - random notes, like command references
